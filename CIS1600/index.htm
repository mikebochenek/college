270-1600 Foundations of Programming
<p>All the assignments are in JAVA and compile using Sun's JDK 1.1.6 or
later.
<p>Assignment #1: <a href="AssignmentOne.java">AssignmentOne.java</a>
- My very first programming assignment at University.&nbsp; It's embarrasingly
simple, it simply asks the user to enter a number in pounds and converts
it to kilograms.
<p>Assignment #2: <a href="Assignment2.java">Assignment2.java</a>
- This program will ask the user to enter time and distance run, and will
output various statistics, such as average speed, time required for each
km/mile run, etc.
<p>Assignment #3: <a href="Personnel.java">Personnel.java</a>
- This program reads information about employees and stores it in an array
of structures and displays a menu.&nbsp; Using the menu, the user can print
hightest/lowest paid employees, print a list of all employees, etc.
<p>Assignment #4: <a href="Draw.java">Draw.java</a>
- This one is a little bit more fun.&nbsp; It is a Java Applet that allows
you to draw simple objects using the mouse.&nbsp; You can draw rectangles,
circles, lines, and points in black.&nbsp; <a href="file://c:/beast/final/code/270-1600/Draw.html">Click
here</a> if you want to run it.
