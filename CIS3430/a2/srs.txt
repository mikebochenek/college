                     SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

*** Introduction ***
- The primary objective of the software system is to create an internet
  shop with automated features.
- The software system will be compromised of two interfaces:
1) The customer module will enable customers to perform basic tasks such as:
   subscription, purchases, data modification, and deletion.
2) The manager module will enable managers to perform advanced administrative
   tasks on the customer database, and on the product database.

*** Information Description ***
- Both databases will be saved in a plain text file.  
  (This means that in theory the data file could be modified, but this 
  is not recommended since the data is saved in a special format.)
- Customer database:
  - Will contain the following fields: surname, given name, e-mail,
    phone number, mailing address, age group, sex, credit card number,
    date of last purchase, permissions to receive e-mail promotions.
  - The customer database will be sorted by surname
    - if any surnames are the same, the entries will be sorted by given name
    - if any given names are the same, the entries will be sorted by E-mail
    - entries with identical surnames, names, and E-mail will be disallowed
- Product database:
   - Will contain the following fields: reference name, UPC, price,
     amount on hand, shipping time, cost, supplier E-mail.
   - The product database will be sorted by reference name
     - If any reference names are the same, the entries will be sorted by UPC
     - Entries with identical reference names, and UPC will be disallowed

*** Functional Description ***
- The Customer Module will enable customers to perform the following tasks:
1) Subscribe - An individual must first subscribe before he or she can become
   a customer and have the ability to make purchases.  During the subscription
   process, the new customer will be asked to enter personal information such
   as name, E-mail address, etc (See above for details).  The customer will be
   accepted based on the data rules specified above (Trying to enter duplicate 
   customers will result in error).  At this point the user will be assigned 
   a randomly generated password.  The password can be changed at the
	customer discretion.
2) Browse Products - Will show all the products that are sold in the
   store.  Product name, UPC code, price, quantity on hand, and the 
	shipping time.  The following actions are defined: 
	- A user that is not a member may browse the list of products,
	  but as soon as he/she tries to purchase an item, they will be asked to
	  log in.
	- A user that is already logged in, may freely purchase an item.
	- Upon selecing "Purchase"
	  - The user will be asked to enter the quantity
	    - The quantity will be checked for availability
		 - If the quantity on hand does not meet needs.
		   a) The customer will be notified through a message box.
		   b) The supplier will be sent an e-mail with an order.
	  - The user will then be asked to pick one out of three shipping methods.  
	  - The user will be notified by e-mail of the purchase being placed. 
	  - If the new quantity on hand is low (equal to zero), then the supplier
	    will be sent an e-mail with an order.
3) Modify Personal Data - This option will be disabled for users who are
   currently not logged in.  The user will have the ability to change any
   of the information provided during the subscription process.  Changing
   of the name will only be permitted if that new name still satisfies the
   data rules specified above.  Changing the password will not be allowed
   here.
4) Cease being a customer - This option will be disabled for users who are
   currently not logged in.  Selecting this option will delete the customer
   from the database of customers.  A customer may only delete himself or
   herself. 
5) Login - The user will be asked to enter the E-mail address and the
   password.  As the password is typed, each character will appear as a
   a star, in order to increase security.
6) Logout - This option will be disabled for users who are currently not 
   logged in.  This is a way for the customer to indicate that they wish
   to leave the store.  Selecting this option will not exit the program.
7) Change Password - The user will be asked to provide the E-mail 
   address and the current password and enter the new password twice.
   The new password will have to be at least 6 characters in length.
   When entering the old and new passwords, each character typed will appear 
	as a star, in order to increase security.
- The Manager Module can be accessed locally and remotely:
  - When accessing remotely the manager will need to provide a login
    and a password (see README file).
  - When accessing locally, the program is run in the same directory
    as the database files.
- The Manager Module will enable managers to perform the following tasks:
- Managing the Customer Database:
1) Inclusion - new customers will be added (in correct order) into
   database.  Trying to enter duplicate customers will result in error.
   (Duplicate customers are customers that have identical surnames,
   given names, and e-mail addresses).
2) Modification - first the manager would specify which customer to edit, and 
   once this customer is found, the manager would be able to modify the fields
3) Deletion - the manager would enter the surname or given name or e-mail 
   of the customer to be deleted, and the system would request confirmation
   before a deletion is performed.  If multiple customers match the criteria
   then a prompt will be displayed for each customer.
4) Query - Will search all for customers that have similar characteristics.
5) E-mail - sending of promotional E-mail to customers is performed here. 
   Only the users that agreed to receive mass E-mail will be included in the 
	mailing list.  The manager will type the message to be send out and 
	all willing customers will receive the advertisement.
- Managing the Product Database:
1) Inclusion - new products will be added (in correct order) into database.
   Trying to enter duplicate products will result in error. (Duplicate 
   products are products that have identical reference names, and UPCs)
2) Modification - first the manager would specify which product to edit, and
   once this product is found, the manager would be able to modify the fields
3) Deletion - the manager would enter the reference name or UPC or supplier
   of he product to be deleted, and the system would request confirmation
   before a deletion is performed.  If multiple products match the criteria
   then a prompt will be displayed for each product.
4) Supply Query - the user will enter search criteria, and a list
   of products will be generated.  From this list, only the products which
   have less than 10 items on hand will be selected.  This list of products
   (and associated information) will be displayed.

*** Validation Criteria ***
- Items should be added, deleted, searched in the database efficiently.
  (those operations should preferably have a time complexity of lg (n))
- The manager should be notified of when an error occurs when writing/reading
  to/from the database file.
