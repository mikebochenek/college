Assignment 2:  Talking to the magic ORB!

DESCRIPTION
------------

*** Execution ***

(1) you need to first launch osagent (ie 'osagent &')

(2) type 'make' to compile

(3) type 'vbj Server' to launch the Server

(4) type 'vbj Client1 hostname FirstExample' or 
    'vbj Client1 hostname SecondExample' to launch Client1.
    (also, you can run it with any other file which conforms to standard 
     posted on the web)

(5) type 'vbj Client2 hostname FirstExample' or 
    'vbj Client2 hostname SecondExample' to launch Client2.
    The filename provided in step (4) is used to name the dataset, and 
    thus Client2 is invoked with the same dataset name (at this stage the 
    files FirstExample and SecondExample may be removed from the directory).

NOTE:  While steps (1), (2) and (3) must be executed in sequance, and once only,
steps (4) and (5) may be executed multiple times in any order.


*** Design ***

Client1, Client2 and Server work as specified in the assignment (uninteresting).

-> The Server is able to store (and serve) data on more than one dataset.
   Thus the dataset name is significant.
-> Calculating the median for even numbers is done by 'rounding-up'
   (in other words the median for a set of 10 numbers will be the 6th number, 
    not the 5th). 
-> In theory you could add two datasets simultanously, and perform queries at 
   the same time.
-> If you wish to modify the source code and attempt different tests, please 
   do so with caution, and refer to Client1.java and Client2.java for examples.
-> run 'javadoc *.java' to see description of classes and methods.
