Assignment 2:  Talking to the magic ORB!

LIMITS
-------

- works for file(s) provided and not 100% flexible for changes to files
  (assuming that the colon (':') is where the data starts)
- limited to n features, where n is currently equal to 128
- name of filename storing data is assumed to be the name of the dataset
- Median values or different from median values provided in example
  (note that median for an even number of elements is determined arbitrarily)
- The client program is 'blocked' when it adds data to the dataset since
  it indirectly waits for the server to accept the data so that the 
  client can get statistics on that dataset.
