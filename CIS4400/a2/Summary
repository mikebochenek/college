Assignment 2:  Talking to the magic ORB!

SUMMARY
-------

The biggest problem was getting the client and server talking to each other.
Once that was out of the way, it was pretty much downhill, except for a minor
setback dealing with data types in NeuralNetDataImpl.java, which had
to match the data types specified in NeuralNetData.idl according to
the funky rules as explained in the textbook.

The Java programming was straightforward.

Oh, yeah, I even got CORBA throwing exceptions (when you try to 
add the same dataset twice).
