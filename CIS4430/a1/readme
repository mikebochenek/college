COMPILING:
	type 'make' to compile both p1 and p2

EXECUTION:
	'p1'
	'p2'

KEY ASSUMPTIONS:
- I am assuming that the pointer takes 8-bytes because it is stored in a
  character array as opposed to a more efficient method.
- Key comparisons are done based by ASCII value, which means the comparisons
  are case-sensitive


KNOWN BUGS:
- Deletion works only sometimes.
