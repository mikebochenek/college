/* CIS*4600 Elements of Theory of Computation
   Assignment #2, Due: Thursday November 2, 2000
   Michael Bochenek ID: 0041056 */

COMPILING:
	type 'make' to compile.

EXECUTION:
	type 'a2 regexp' - where regexp is the regular expression.
(regexp should be enclosed in quotation marks if it contains
special characters (+ or *)). 

   type 'a2 regexp -nfa' - to see the NonDeterministic Finite
State Automaton, which is an intermediate stage in the 
creation of a DFA.

LIST OF INCLUDED FILES:
	README - this file (you are reading)
	a2 - Assignment #2 executable
	a2.c - source code for the main program (a2)
   a2.h - source code for the main program (a2)
	makefile - makefile used to compile the project

EXAMPLE OF OUTPUT GENERATED BY PROGRAM:

Here is an example automation file.  It has 4 total states, and 2 of them
are accept states (1,3).  All the possible transitions are
listed starting on the third line, with "1 2 a", which means that there
is a transition from State#1 to State#2 on input character 'a'.

14
1 3
1 2 a
2 3 a
3 4 a


end.
