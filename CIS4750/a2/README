QUESTIONS FROM THE TEXTBOOK:
3.17
(a) Defining the problem:
Initial state : This is the state of the world according to the agent.  
   Here, all the agent knows is that it is somewhere inside a 3x3 matrix.
Operators : There are 4 actions available to the agent: move forward, turn
   right 90 degrees, turn left 90 degrees, and suck up dirt.
Goal test function : If the agent has visited all the of the nine squares,
   then it has achieved it's goal.
Path cost function : The cost function is as outline in question 2.5, namely
   +100 points for each piece of dirt sucked up, and -1 point for each action.

(b) The iterative depth search is best suited.

(c) This question is answered by the program 'vacuum'.

(d) This question is answered by the program 'vacuum'.

(e) Computation time is not an issue in either simulation.

(f) not required.
