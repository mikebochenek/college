 CHAPTER 1:  INTRODUCTION
--------------------------

1.1  What is the Mandelbrot Set?

Before anyone starts using MandelView 1.0, it is crucial to know
what the Mandelbrot Set is.  First of all, the Mandelbrot Set is
named after Benoit B. Mandelbrot, who was a researcher at the IBM
Thomas J. Watson Research Centre in Yorktown Heights, New York. 
Basically, the Mandelbrot Set is a famous fractal (a fractal is
defined as a shape that contains an infinite amount of detail). 
No matter how much the Mandelbrot Set is enlarged, there is still
more detail to be revealed by enlarging it more.  MandelView 1.0
is a tool that allows the user to display the Mandelbrot Set on
the computer screen, and enlarge any part of it by "zooming-in"
with the mouse.

1.2  About MandelView 1.0

MandelView 1.0 was created using Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 as an
independent study project for my computer programming class. 
There is good chance that there will be another release with a
number of improvements in the future.

 CHAPTER 2:  INSTALLING THE PROGRAM
------------------------------------

2.1  Minimum requirements

The minimum requirements are:
- 386 processor
- 4 megabytes of RAM
- approximately 1.8 megabytes of hard disk space
- a mouse
- Windows 3.1 or later
Note that when zooming, this program performs millions of
calculations per second, and therefore a 386 will be much, much
slower than a Pentium (for example, a 386DX 40 Mhz will take
about 10 TIMES as much time as a Cyrix 166 Mhz).  However, the
amount of RAM does not effect the performance of the program as
drastically as the CPU.

2.2  How to install the program

There is no special installation procedures.  Simply copy the
files into any directory and run MAIN.EXE.  For example, in MS-
DOS you might type the following commands.
     C:\>MD MANDEL
     C:\>CD MANDEL
     C:\>COPY A:\*.* C:

2.3  Files needed to run the program

All the files that are necessary to run this program should be
included in the ZIP file.  For general knowledge, these are the
files:
     filename:      size:     use:
     BOOKMARK.DAT   varies    File with all your bookmarks
     MAIN.EXE       62 KB     The Executable
     OC25.DLL       524 KB    Dynamic Link Library (needed)
     README.DOC     12 KB     Digital Manual
     TYPELIB.DLL    174 KB    Dynamic Link Library (needed)
     VB40016.DLL    914 KB    Dynamic Link Library (needed)

 CHAPTER 4:  USER'S GUIDE
--------------------------

4.1  User's Guide

When you first run the program, it automatically calculates the
main start up image.  The progress bar will display the progress
and please be patient, because on some machines it may take a
while.  From there on you are on your own.

You may zoom into any area that you want using the mouse.  Click
and hold the left mouse button in the approximate area where you
want the upper-right corner of the zoombox to be.  Then, drag the
mouse down and to the left (while holding the mouse button) until
a white box appears around the area that you want to zoom into. 
When you are satisfied with your selection, then you should let
go of the left mouse button.  At that time the computer will
again recalculate and zoom into your selected area.  Again, this
may take a while.  In this way you can zoom as much as you
desire.

If after zooming, you are not satisfied with the new image, you
can easily go back to the previous screen by going to the
"Bookmarks" menu and selecting the "Back" option.  An the other
hand, if you really like the new image, you may want to add it to
your list of bookmarks by going to the "Bookmarks" menu and
selecting the "Add to bookmark" option.  This bookmark is
automatically saved to the file BOOKMARK.DAT, and is loaded each
time you run the program.  At any time, you can retrieve the
saved bookmark by going to the "Bookmarks" menu and selecting "Go
to bookmark".  This will load up the bookmarks window where you
can go to a specific bookmark or delete a specific bookmark (Note
that there is a thumbnail image to help you distinguished your
bookmarks).  To return to the main screen, simply click cancel. 
The bookmarks window is very similar to the history window, which
can be accessed by clicking on the "Go to history" menu item. 
The history window shows a list of all the zooms that you have
performed during your current session.

If you want to change the maximum number of iterations or the
colours used, you can do so in the options menu.  It is really
recommended that you play around with the color option to find
out what your changes effect.

At any time, you can resize the window, be sure to note that it
will take longer to zoom in if your windows is larger.  When you
find an image that you really like, you have the opportunity to
save it into a TrueVision Targa bitmap, and you can specify the
width and height.  To do this, go into the "File" menu and select
"Save As".  If you want to use it as a wallpaper in Windows, try
640x480, 800x600, or 1024x768.

If for any reason you should want to start over, rather then
exiting the program and running it again, simply go to the "File"
menu and select "Start Over".  Also, "Exit" and "Redraw" is found
in the "File" menu.  "Redraw" is used to repaint the image in the
window if you should desire to do so.

 CHAPTER 5:  TROUBLESHOOTING 
-----------------------------

5.1  Troubleshooting

Here is a list of errors that the user may encounter:

PROBLEM:  When MAIN.EXE is run under Windows 95, the program
stops with the error message saying that a device attached to the
system is not functioning.
FIX:  Run MAIN.EXE again and it will work fine.

PROBLEM:  When I zoom in, the image lacks detail/sharpness.
FIX:  Increase the maximum number of iterations.  It is useful to
play around with the colour and iterations options to achieve the
ultimate experience.
